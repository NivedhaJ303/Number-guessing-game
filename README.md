🎮 Number Guessing Game

This Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game implemented in Java. The objective is for the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback after each guess (whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct), and it continues until the player guesses the correct number.

🚀 Features
- Random number generation within a defined range
- User input handling through the console
- Feedback after each guess (too high, too low, or correct)

- Simple, procedural approach without the use of object-oriented programming

🛠 Technologies Used
